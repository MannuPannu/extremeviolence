# extremeviolence

With the aim of remaking the classic AMIGA game Extreme Violence I set forth on an adventure through javascript land!

* Make this list longer
* Create js object handling (creating, extending etc). Maybe using stampit?
* Add require.js?
* Create input helper to move around rectangle on screen.
